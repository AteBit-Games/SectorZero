  content: "A slow, but exponential chain reaction is observed between the Monolith
    and exposed matter. Increased exposure feeds the growth of affected materials.
    Over time the strength of the exposure has increased, suggesting that the Monolith
    produces a greater effect when surrounded in the presence of more affected material.\r\n\r\nWhile
    only a theory, the implications of such a symbiotic relationship are a cause
    for great concern. Containment should be the first priority.\r"
