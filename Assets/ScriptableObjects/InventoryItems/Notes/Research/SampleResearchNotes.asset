  title: Sector Zero sample #16
  author: Dr. Evan Kolvak
  date: 1975.01.27
  content: "The inorganic material appears to exhibit \u201Corganic\u201D behaviours
    under constant exposure. Pieces of the sample fuse together to create semi-volatile
    bonds. The affected clusters appear to compete for control over the weaker clusters
    and unaffected material.\n\r\nExposure to inorganic material stimulates and feeds
    the growth process. The effects wear off after time leaving a stable but transformed
    product.\r\n\r\nExposure to organic material causes unpredictable mutations varying
    from subject to subject. The results are as of yet inconclusive.\n\n- Sample
    acquired 22 metres from the Monolith.\n- 12 hours since exposure.\r\n"
